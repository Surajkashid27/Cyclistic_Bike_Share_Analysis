# Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Analysis
This repository contains the Cyclistic bike-share analysis project. It includes data on ride frequency, duration, and bike types, segmented into casual riders and annual members. The analysis provides insights to develop targeted marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members and improve service efficiency.

This repository contains the data, code, and documentation for the analysis of Cyclistic bike share data. The primary objective of this analysis is to understand the usage patterns of Cyclistic bikes by different rider segmentsâ€”casual riders and annual members. The insights gained from this analysis aim to support strategic decisions to enhance service and increase annual memberships.
